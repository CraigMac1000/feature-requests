# Welcome to the Beaver Builder Feature Requests and Roadmap board.  
This is here as a result of customer feedback that you all would like a place to post and vote
on feature requests as well see what we're working on.

This is an experiment and we may decide that this won't work in the long run but we'd like to see if it can!

## How to Use

### Post Feature Requests
Review existing feature requests and if yours isn't listed, post it in [Issues](https://github.com/beaverbuilder/feature-requests/issues).  Make sure to select the right product so that it gets labeled appropriately.

### Vote on Feature Requests
When you open a feature request (issue) you will see a smiley face.  Please click that and select the Thumbs Up icon for a +1.  This will ensure your vote is counted and then we can filter the results by the number of Thumbs Ups as well.  Please note, Thumbs up will be the only accepted way to vote (if we could remove the other options, we would).  Comments and other icon clicks will not be counted towards the vote total.  

If you don't think a feature is a good idea, please click on the Thumbs Down icon instead.

Example of how to vote on an issue:

![vote](https://p199.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/eDu14qwb/Screen%20Recording%202020-07-20%20at%2010.44.27%20AM.gif?v=a9f2d154cbdc84bc70f4d988039dd1fb)

### See the Roadmap

Click on Projects then Roadmap or just [click here](https://github.com/beaverbuilder/feature-requests/projects/1).  There you can see what feature requests we are considering, what we've already started or are testing and what was recently pushed live.

### Please do not
Add any other labels, milestones or add any issues to the Projects.  That will be done by BB staff as appropriate.


### If you come here and the Issues section does not exist
That means that we've closed that down temporarily to manage and it will open back up again when we've done our maintenance.

# One caveat
Just because a feature request is really popular does not mean it will get added.  While customer feedback is really important to us, there are other factors we include in feature decisions.
